Every custom class me define has inheritance of OBJECT. The object class has default __init__ method which will
also be applied to our custom class if __init__ is not specifically defined.
__init__ magic method attaches data attributes to the newly created instance where 'self'
is actually the instance itself.

Attributes are data and procedures (methods) that belong to the class. Attributes
are DATA and METHODS.
METHODS:
- define the behavior of the class instance (object)
- the instance object is passed as first argument - 'self'
- can alter data attributes of the instance

BUILT-IN METHODS //MAGIC METHODS //DUNDER METHODS
__init__ - called automatically when class object is initialized

__str__ - custom string representation of our new class. If defined in the
new class, it overwrites the default __str__ method. Default value of this
method is "memory object". It is called with print() or if str() called.
Print() is parsing all info to strings. This method should have a returned
value of string, otherwise will trow error

__repr__ - machine readable representation of the user's class. It is useful
when debbuging since it shows all variables values during debug.

DATA ATTRIBUTE: - stored internally and are unique to that object. THey define
state of the object
- class attr - shared by all instances of the class
- instance attr - unique to each instance
