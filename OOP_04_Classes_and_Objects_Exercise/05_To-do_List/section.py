"""
The Section class should receive a name (string) upon initialization. The task also has one instance attribute:
tasks (empty list)
The Section class should also have four methods:
- add_task(new_task: Task)
o Adds a new task to the collection and returns "Task {task details} is added to the
section"
o If the task is already in the collection, returns "Task is already in the section
{section_name}"
- complete_task(task_name: str)
o Changes the task to completed (True) and returns "Completed task {task_name}"
o If the task is not found, returns "Could not find task with the name {task_name}"
- clean_section()
o Removes all the completed tasks and returns "Cleared {amount of removed tasks}
tasks."
- view_section()
o Returns information about the section and its tasks in this format:
 "Section {section_name}:
 {details of the first task}
 {details of the second task}
 â€¦
 {details of the n task}"
