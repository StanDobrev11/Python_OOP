abstraction - to show to the reader what a peace of code does without the need of explaining it.

Scope and namespace:
Namespace - the area of access of given variable.
-builtin - abs(), sum()
-global - all what is defined in the file or imported
-local - all defined in class or function

local namespace can use all information of the other namespaces, however without changing them.
GLOBAL can be used in order to change global var from local scope.

Scope is the region of action of the variable.

Class is a blueprint for an object that defines its nature
Class Name is written in PascalCase.
A class object has STATE - which are features like weight, color, name...
and BEHAVIOUR - functions, call methods, that describe objects motion or actions.
The __init__ method keeps all STATE data. When an object (instance) is created,
the __init__ method is automatically called.
The instance is a specific realization of an object of a certain class.
self.__dict__ returns the STATE of the current instance.
attributes is considered data attributes (STATE) and methods (BEHAVIOUR)
