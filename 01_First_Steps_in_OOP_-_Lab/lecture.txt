abstraction - to show to the reader what a peace of code does without the need of explaining it.

Scope and namespace:
Namespace - the area of access of given variable.
-builtin - abs(), sum()
-global - all what is defined in the file or imported
-local - all defined in class or function

local namespace can use all information of the other namespaces, however without changing them.
GLOBAL can be used in order to change global var from local scope.

Scope is the region of action of the variable.
