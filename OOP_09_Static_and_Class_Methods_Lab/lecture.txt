Static methods = @staticmethod
 It knows nothing about the class or the instance!!
 Cannot modify object state or class state.
 Easily could be made as function.
 It is kept in the class only to maintain the consept of the OOP and to pack
similar methods within the class
 Can be called through the instance or the class. However, it is better to
be called through the class.


 ClassMethod = @classmethod
 it is bound to the class and not to the object.
 Can modify only class state. Mainly used to create new instances with controlled
 functions. It is CONTROLLED because we control what to be passed to the instance
 as arguments
 cls - refers to the class, name of the class and create new instance.
provides shortcut for creating new instance object
following DRY principle

Overiding using class methods
