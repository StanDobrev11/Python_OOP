"""
The Player class should receive a name (string), a hp (int), and a mp (int) upon initialization. The Player also has 2
instance attributes: skills (an empty dictionary that will contain the skills of each player and its mana cost) and a
guild set to "Unaffiliated" by default
The Player class should also have two additional methods:
- add_skill(skill_name, mana_cost)
o Adds the skill and the corresponding mana cost to the dictionary of skills. Returns "Skill
{skill_name} added to the collection of the player {player_name}"
o If the skill is already in the collection, returns "Skill already added"
- player_info()
o Returns the player's information, including their skills, in this format:
"Name: {player_name}
Guild: {guild_name}
HP: {hp}
MP: {mp}
==={skill_name_1} - {skill_mana_cost}
==={skill_name_2} - {skill_mana_cost}
â€¦
==={skill_name_N} - {skill_mana_cost}"
